<h1> <code>R</code>esearch</h1>

Graduated from Stony Brook University with a master's degree in computational linguistics.
My research focused on using advanced stylometric feature extraction to embed language data into high-dimensional vectors.
These vectors were then used for _authorship attribution_, the task of automatically identifying the author of a document.
This work was done with [Dr. Owen Rambow](https://owenrambow.com/) on the [IARPA HIATUS grant](https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/hiatus)
for which I authored two Python software for performing quantitative analysis over English grammar:
[Gram2Vec](https://github.com/eric-sclafani/gram2vec) and [Sentence Regex Matcher (SRM)](https://github.com/eric-sclafani/syntax-regex-matcher).

Outside of computational linguistics, I also love data analysis and exploration. When I'm not working, I enjoy writing EDA code on interesting datasets. In particular,
I love crafting beautiful and interactive data visualizations using Python's Dash and Plotly packages. In my off time, I am currently working on an interactive language data
visualization tool to hopefully assist NLP engineers with text data EDA.

<h1> <code>H</code>obbies</h1>
My primary hobby is teaching myself new skills. Over the years, I've taught myself many things such as python, machine learning, math 
(linear algebra, stats, probability, differential calculus), and more. I am currently on a journey to vastly improve my machine learning/deep learning knowledge and skillset.
In the future, I also want to teach myself web development with Javascript.

Outside of techy stuff, I love reading. My favorite genre is horror and favorite author is H.P. Lovecraft. I also enjoy photography, specifically taking macro photos of plants and insects (check out my Gallery!).
