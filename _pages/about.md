<h1> <code>R</code>esearch</h1>

Graduated from Stony Brook University with a master's in computational linguistics. My research focuses on using linguistically motivated stylometric feature extraction to perform authorship attribution, the task of automatically identifying the author of a document. This work was performed with [Dr. Owen Rambow](https://owenrambow.com/) on the [IARPA HIATUS grant](https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/hiatus). 

My other research interests span both computational linguistics and NLP, including formal language theory, explainable AI, and low-resource NLP. Outside of the language domain, I also enjoy using data science, machine learning, and visualization techniques to analyze numerical datasets.

<h1> <code>H</code>obbies</h1>
My primary hobby is teaching myself new skills. Over the years, I've taught myself many things such as python, machine learning, math (linear algebra, stats, probability, differential calculus), and more. I am currently on a journey to vastly improve my machine learning/deep learning knowledge and skillset. I also want to teach myself Ruby and web development with Ruby on Rails.

Outside of techy stuff, I love reading. My favorite genre is horror and favorite author is H.P. Lovecraft. I also enjoy photography, specifically taking macro photos of plants and insects (check out my Gallery!).
